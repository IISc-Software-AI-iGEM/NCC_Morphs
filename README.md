# Ion Channels, NCC and Gitelman Syndrome
Our goal is to simulate the ion channel in the DCT(Distal Convoluted Tubule) in Nephron and deal with Gitelman syndrome which mainly occurs in a protein called NCC. The mutations occured in it causes the sydrome. <br>


We will use <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P55017/entry"> https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P55017/entry </a> for all the references for NCC.
